D4 stands for 'Droid Dropbox Directory Downloader, and as its name suggests, facilitates downloads of enitre folders from the Dropbox app for Android phones. Quite a specific purpose, but the current app only allows files to be added, and I felt support for folders would be nice too.
To use, simply download the APK and install to your phone, then go to the Dropbox app, choose a directory and long press it. Tap "Share To", then choose this app. The folder should now be in the downloads directory of your phone!

To do:
Progress bar.
Better data strucutres - associative arrays / dictionaries for lists of files and folders.
Add all exception catching and error messages.
Text box for url if not launched from dropbox.
Option to visit folder when download completes.
