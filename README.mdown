D4 stands for 'Droid Dropbox Directory Downloader, and as its name suggests, facilitates downloads of enitre folders from the Dropbox app for Android phones. Quite a specific purpose, but the current app only allows files to be added, and I felt support for folders would be nice too.
To use, simply build to your phone, then go to the Dropbox app, choose a directory and long press it. Tap Share To, then choose this app (currently still called MainActivity). The folder should now be in the downloads directory of your phone!

To do:
Files are not yet downloaded prooperly -  a problem with the buffer in the download method. Fix one method, the whole program will work.
Progress bar.
better data strucutres - associate arrays for lists of files and folders.
Add all exception catching and error messages.
